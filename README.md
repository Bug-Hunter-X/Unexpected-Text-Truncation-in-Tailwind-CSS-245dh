# Unexpected Text Truncation in Tailwind CSS

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Tailwind CSS related to unexpected text truncation or overflow when dealing with long lines of text within a container.  The issue seems to be related to the interaction between line length and Tailwind's default line-clamping behavior (or lack thereof) possibly exacerbated by other styles.

## Bug Description

The bug manifests as text being unexpectedly truncated or overflowing its container, even when it appears there should be sufficient space. This is not a typical overflow issue but may be due to an interaction between long lines and Tailwind's styling rules or other CSS properties.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js` (or equivalent for your chosen environment).
3. Observe the rendered output. You should see unexpected text truncation.

## Solution

The provided solution in `bugSolution.js` demonstrates a way to address the issue, potentially by adjusting line clamping behaviour or other CSS properties that might be causing the conflict. See the file for a detailed solution.
