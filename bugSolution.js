```javascript
<div class="bg-gray-100 p-4">
  <p class="text-xl font-bold">Solution: Handling Long Lines in Tailwind CSS</p>
  <p class="text-ellipsis overflow-hidden">
    This is a paragraph with some text that has a relatively long line length. This long line length might be causing issues because of Tailwind's default line-clamp behaviour, leading to unexpected text truncation or overflow. This solution demonstrates using `text-ellipsis` and `overflow-hidden` to handle this properly, but more custom solutions might be required depending on the layout.
